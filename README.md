# reqvm

reqvm is a bytecode virtual machine written as learning experience, there's probably some weird design choices, but I don't really care.

This repository also contains a basic assembler for the VM.

If you wish to build the project yourself, check out the [build instructions](documentation/build_instructions.md).

More documentation to come as I write it.
